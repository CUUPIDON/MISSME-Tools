# MISSME-Tools
These are small and simple scipts for both Blender 2.70 and 2.79. I've made them so they take the leg-work out of content creation. 

I originally wrote these because I thought that maybe Blender would work like Photo Shop and I could, in a way, record actions. I did find a way to do that and I just sorta sat on them for a while. Then I got off my behind and made a simple interface so they're more friendly to use.

### Some things to expect: 
1. It does not fully automate the experince so please do not expect it to do so.

2. Please make sure you read the [WIKI](https://github.com/MISSME12/MISSME-Tools/wiki#missme-tools-wiki) on how to install and use my tools.

3. I like to think these script are intermediate-friendly. Please do not create issues about basic how-to-use blender problems, I will not answer them.

4. If you run into any problems when using the scirpts, please READ the error that blender gives before creating a new issue or emailing me. Sometimes blender will actually tell you whats wrong without you having to come to me.

With that in mind, please enjoy and use responsibly! 

I mean that.
